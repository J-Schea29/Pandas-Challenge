# Pandas-Challenge


For this challenge, I analyzed trends in the data for standardized testing reults in a school district. I think the biggest take away from the data is that charter schools are on average 37% less likely to pass both reading and math than dictrict students in standarized testing.

|          | average_reading_score  | % Passed Reading  | % Passed Math  | average_math_score	| % Passed  |
| -------- |:----------------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|:------------------:|:---------:|
| Charter  | 83.896421              | 83.473852         | 96.586489      | 93.620830          | 90.432244 |
| District | 80.966636              | 76.956733         | 80.799062      | 66.548453          | 53.672208 |

Which leads to my second takeaway, which is that more money per student does not necessarily equal better grades. Although there appears to be a sweet spot where grades are increased by greater spending, after this spots grades rapidly decline with increasing spending. Which makes me to wonder whether the spending per student can be truly said to be accurate (i.e. is the money going toward paying school adminstration salary or buy kids laptops for school.) Prehaps Charters are just more efficient with their money causing a greater real spending per student.
