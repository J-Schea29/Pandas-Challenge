# Pandas-Challenge


For this challenge, I analyzed trends in the data for standardized testing reults in a school district. I think the biggest take away from the data is that charter schools are on average doing 37% less likely to pass both reading and math than dictrict students in standarized testing. This is while spending far less than district school. Which leads to my second takeaway, which is that more money per student does not necessarily equal better grades. Although there appears to be a sweet spot where grades are increase by greater spending, after this spots grades rapidly decline with increasing spending. This leads me to wonder whether the spending per student can be truly said to be accurate (I would want to look at how each school spent their budget to see if the money is really adding value to childs education.) Prehaps Charters are just more efficient with their money causing a greater real spending per student.
